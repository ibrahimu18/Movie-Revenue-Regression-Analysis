# Movie-Revenue-Regression-Analysis

This project applies various different regression techniques (Linear, Robust, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) to predict box office revenue from the TDMB (The Movie Database) dataset.

## Future Steps

- Apply variance stabilizing transformation to the response to stabilize variance and improve model validity
- Implement Polynomial Regression
- Add Neural Network Model
